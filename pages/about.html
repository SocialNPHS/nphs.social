  <p>
    SocialNPHS is a project to analyze New Paltz High School through data from
  social media, specifically tweets.
  </p>

  <h2 class="md-display-1">How does it work?</h2>
  <p>
    SocialNPHS reads tweets from a
    <a href="https://twitter.com/1Defenestrator/lists/nphs">twitter list</a>
    which includes a majority of New Paltz High School students. Then,
    SocialNPHS gathers a few forms of data.
    <ol>
      <li>
        SocialNPHS reads and records simple metrics like tweet
        frequency over time.
      </li>
      <li>
        SocialNPHS analyzes tweets one-by-one using a variety of natural
        language processing techniques. This allows for collection of data like the
        typical sentiment of a user's tweets.
      </li>
      <li>
        SocialNPHS looks up tweet authors in a small database to gain
        additional context, such as to which grade a user belongs. This can be used
        to view data more specifically and gain further insights.
      </li>
    </ol>
